Files.wxs was generated by publishing the WebApp and then the WiX Harvest Tool (Heat)
Heat is documented here: http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/overview/heat.html


Steps:
------
1: Publish the WebApp project to C:\drops\
2: Open the PowerShell script located in the BasicFileCopy directory (heatScript.ps1)
3: Modify the $outputWxs variable to match the path of your BasicFileCopy project directory
4: Run the heatScript.ps1 script.  Doing so generates the Files.wxs file.
